\section{Future Work}
With this work, we have taken a small step towards creating a simpler method for software developers to model hardware as well as verify properties within this model. In future work, we would like to extend this to software-hardware co-design, with which we would be able to assert deadlocks.

It would be desirable to be able to automatically create a human-readable report on the ranges and communications that are used within the system. This could become a standard addition to the documentation of the system, which would give a programmer an easy overview of a complicated system and would also allow for easier contemplation over the system.

Another, more complex idea for future work, is to implement support for multi-channel invariants. This is not something that can easily be simulated and therefore it would require some work, but it would provide the ability to express more complex assertions.
