@article{Lamport1984,
abstract = {Generalized Hoare Logic is a formal logical system for deriving invariance properties of programs. It provides a uniform way to describe a variety of methods for reasoning about concurrent programs, including noninterference, satisfaction, and cooperation proofs. We describe a simple recta-rule of the Generalized Hoare Logic -the Decomposition Principle- and show how all these methods can be derived using it.},

@article{Holzmann1997,
abstract = {SPIN is an efficient verification system for models of distributed software systems. It has been used to detect design errors in applications ranging from high-level descriptions of distributed algorithms to detailed code for controlling telephone exchanges. This paper gives an overview of the design and structure of the verifier, reviews its theoretical foundation, and gives an overview of significant practical applications.},
