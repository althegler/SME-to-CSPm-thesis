% (from analysis)
% In the SME model, processes never terminate, but when simulating an SMEIL program, it is necessary to terminate the simulation at some point, but it should simply be seen as a snapshot of the process and not that the process terminates when the simulation ends.
% The number of clock cycles, the simulation is run for, is specified via the command line tool.
% There is, of course, limitations to the simulation, and it is important to note that the simulation is a simple tool to simulate the running system, however it does necessary provide all possible results of the system. If a system fails at a 1000 clock cycles, but the system is only simulated for 100 clock cycles, then we would not know about the failure. If the translation use the observed values from a simulation, the user need to know the limitations of the simulation.
% % If the simulation is not passing through enough clock cycles, the verification might be inadequate. Since the verification builds on the observed values, the simulation needs to be long enough such that the whole possible range of input values is exhausted. %TODO: Where should I add this? Removed it from the background section
