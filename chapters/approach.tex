There are several different ways to use SMEIL, one being co-simulation as described above. However, in this work, we focus on the independent SMEIL representation and thus we only present examples in pure SMEIL. These pure SMEIL programs must contain a process which generates input for the network since the network cannot receive input elsewhere. The program is simulated using the command line tool. Simulation is done in order to test the design of the system.

This property is of great value when translating into \cspm{}, and when creating assertions, since we can use these values to actually assert the network.
