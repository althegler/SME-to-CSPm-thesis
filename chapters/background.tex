In this chapter we briefly introduce SME as well as CSP and in more detail, we introduce SMEIL and \cspm along with the FDR4 tool and its cababilities.

\section{Synchronous Message Exchange}
Since SMEIL is based on the SME model, we give a brief introduction to SME to familiarize the reader with the SME model before introducing SMEIL.
\\

The development of SME was mainly driven by the need to provide a simple framework for programming a Field Programmable Gate
Array, FPGA, since FPGAs can achieve the same performance as a General Purpose Graphical Processing Units, GPGPU, but with much less energy consumption. GPGPUs have been extensively researched and different environments have been implemented to give programmers the posibility of utilizing the cababilities of it, but FPGAs are a far better choice when it comes to energy sensitive applications. The FPGA has not been the subject of as much research as the GPGPU, and when using FPGAs, the developer need to design an integrated circuit on the gate level, which is difficult and not common knowledge these days.
Unfortunately designing hardware is often a tedious task but with SME it becomes more accessable to design and implement hardware models.

SMEs main target is to give software developers a tool which provide the opportunity for the developer to program hardware but with a distance from the hardware details, so in a way, the development resembles the structures and semantics that is known from software development.
Thus the framework is based of a top-down approach rather than a bottom-up approach that is common in the current hardware frameworks.
% Global synchronicity is fundamental when modeling hardware, but CSP does not support this. Even though CSP does enforce strict synchrony between communicating processes, there is no such semantic beging enforced on a global level. % TODO: Do I want to include this?

SME was first introduced in 2014 and after several iterations~\cite{Vinter2014, Vinter2015, Skovhede} now presents as a programming model, a simulation library, and VHDL code generators. %TODO: Add reference!  Different reference in paper than in mendeley. Figure it out. The original idea was conceived following an attempt to create hardware descriptions from a vector processor model, modeled in PyCSP~\cite{bjorndalen2007pycsp},
% TODO: Figure out what the correct reference to this is.
a Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)~\cite{Hoare1978} library for Python.\\

The work was initially presented in the paper \textit{BPU Simulator}~\cite{Rehr2013}. This paper only introduced a high abstraction level simulation and therefore the subject was explored more in detail in the master thesis project \textit{Generation of FPGA Hardware
Specifications from PyCSP Networks}~\cite{Skaarup14}. From the results of the master thesis it was clear that PyCSP could be used to model hardware however the need to enforce global synchrony to the circuit resulted in an explosion in the number of channels for controlling the progress and for simulating the clock, and even simple circuits would become overwhelmingly large.\\

The design approach of the master thesis was to implement a clock process that would drive the circuit. This meant that each process must read the clock signal and in order to avoid race conditions the system had to be implemented with a two-way clock, the so called \textit{tick} and \textit{tock} signals. Since deadlocks can happen in CSP it was important to implement deadlock prevention, which was done by adding channels with a single buffer element. This way, no processes would end up in a deadlock. Figure \ref{fig:sme:clock_latch} shows how a simple CSP network would be modelled in the synchronous PyCSP model. It is clear how trying to use PyCSP for modelling synchronous hardware would result in extremely large networks.

\label{fig:sme:clock_latch}
\end{figure}
\\\\
The advantage of using Python for this kind of processor simulation is the flexibility and simplicity of the language. It is easy to experiment with various ideas and versions but with the increased complexity of the added clock process and and clock-signal propagation, the advantages of Python seemed to diminish. Therefore the conclusion from the master thesis was that using PyCSP alone for building synchronous processor simulators was not feasible since the global clock was forced onto the CSP model. It was also concluded that external choice, which is a powerful and essential part of CSP, was not utilized in the globally synchronous approach. They did, however, conclude that several of other CSP concepts was fitting well with the hardware concepts, such as shared-nothing in CSP matches the structure of hardware communication.\\

After this attempt, it became clear that the structure of CSP was poorly suited for modeling clocked systems, and therefore it was decided to create the Synchronous Message Exchange framework, based on the CSP algebra. The idea was to only use the subset of the CSP algebra that provided beneficial functionality to hardware modeling which, most importantly, meant that external choice was omitted. However, the shared-nothing property of CSP showed to be very useful, since the network state could only be changed by process communication.
\\
% In SME the introduction of an implicit clock that eliminates the complexity caused by the model, described above, was imperative and is one of the key concepts hereof. The implicit clock removed the problems found by forcing the globally synchronous clock onto the CSP model. \\
In SME, a network is a combination of processes that are connected through buses. The processes communicate through a collection of signals in a bus, instead of CSP's synchronous rendezvous model, but retains the shared-nothing trait of CSP.
SME uses the term \texttt{bus} instead of \texttt{channel} to enforce the semantic correlation between the SME bus and a physical hardware signal bus.
The process communication is handled by a hidden clock which eliminates the complexity that arose from adding synchronicity to a CSP network. The combination of the hidden clock and the synchronous message passing between processes means that the SME model provides hardware-like signal propagation.

An SME clock cycle consists of three phases: it reads, executes, and writes as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sme_process_flow}. The process is activated on the rising clock edge where it reads from the bus and it reads, executes and writes to the bus in one clock cycle. Just before the rising edge of the clock, all signals are propagated on all buses which means, that all communication happens simultaneously. Because of this structure, if a value is written by a process in cycle $i$, it is read by the receiving process in cycle $i+1$.

SME is able to detect read/write conflicts where multiple writes are performed to a single bus within the same clock cycle as well as reads from a signal that has not been written to in the previous clock-cycle.\\
All data, that are written to a bus can be logged for each clock cycle which means that these logs can be saved in a Comma-Separated Values, CSV, format and used for validating the VHDL implementation with a VHDL tool. This would eliminate the need to write seperate VHDL tests which will improve developer productivity immensely.

SME also supports clock-multipliers which means that a clocked network can have components inside the network being clocked at a different rate than its own clock. The rate can be an integer multiplier from its own clock. This means that all components are clocked relative to its parent network and therefore the clock will not need any extra coordination. It does however mean that the inner components can only fun faster than their parents.
% TODO: Do I really want this included?

Since an SME network is a network that can be represented as a graph, a diagram tool have also been implemented for SME. It utilizes the Graphviz tool to generate a visual graph of the network. This means that the SME networks can be generated and drawn as a graph which can help with debugging.
%TODO: Also, it this something I really want to include?

Since SME is based on CSP, all SME models have a
corresponding CSP model, and because of this property, we are able to create a transpiler translating SME models to \cspm{}.
The SME model is currently implemented as libraries for the general-purpose languages C\#~\cite{Skovhede}, C++~\cite{asheim2015}, and Python~\cite{asheim2016vhdl}. The Python and C\# libraries both have code generators for VHDL as well.
\newpage
\subsection{SMEIL}
\label{SMEIL-section}
With the different SME implementations, a need arose for a common intermediate language. SME Implementation Language (SMEIL) was developed as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for SME, usable both as an Intermediate Language, IL, and as an independent implementation language. It is accompanied with the implementation, \texttt{LIBSME}. %TODO: Find the reference in truls paper.
SMEIL has a C-like syntax with a specialized type system that makes hardware modeling simple. In spite of its simplicity, SMEIL still provides hardware-specific functionality that is more difficult to create with general-purpose languages.

Programs written in SMEIL are run by using the libsme library. This can be done either by using the command line utility or through the provided API.
The different methods of using SMEIL are:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pure SMEIL simulation:} A pure SMEIL program is a network which do not depend on outside influence. This means that the network  generates the data itself and the only communication are between the processes defined in the network.
    \item \textbf{Co-simulation of SMEIL:} The original intent with SMEIL was to create an intermediate language which could be used together with the general-purpose language implementations of SME, which is called co-simulation. With co-simulation, a test bench can be generated as well as VHDL code.
    \item \textbf{Direct code generation:} A SMEIL program which does not need to simulate before generating VHDL. In this case all types are constrained and all information needed for the code generation are in place. Because the simulation step is not executed, a VHDL test bench is also not automatically generated, since this happens in the simulation step.
\end{itemize}
The base entity of an SMEIL program is the module which corresponds to a file. The module consists of the actual SMEIL program as well as import statements. SMEIL programs can be seperated into modules which can then be importet into other SMEIL programs, creating a library-like structure and reusable components.\\

The SME model supports both synchronous and asynchronous processes. A synchronous process are run during every clock-cycle and an asynchronous process are only run when receiving a signal on the input bus, but unfortunately SMEIL does not currently support asynchronous processes. %TODO: Ask truls if it is implemented in other sme implementations.
\\

The two fundamental components of an SMEIL program is \texttt{process} and \texttt{network}. The process consists of variable and bus definitions, as well as the statements that are evaluated once for each clock cycle. The purpose of the \texttt{network} declaration is to define the relations between each entity in the program. A small example of process and network syntax can be seen in Listing~\ref{lst:smeil_small_syntax_example} and a further introduction to the language can be found in Section \ref{chap:analysis}.\\
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}[escapeinside=||, mathescape=true]{smeil_lexer.py:SMEILLexer -x}
proc addone (in inbus)
    bus outbus {
        val: int;
    };
{
    outbus.val = inbus.val + 1;
}

    |$\vdots$|

network net() {
    instance a of addone(b.outbus);
    instance b of ..
    |$\vdots$|
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Small example of process and network syntax in SMEIL.}
\label{lst:smeil_small_syntax_example}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{SMEIL type system}
The SMEIL language is stongly, statically typed and has a simple type system that is checked at compile-time. The purpose of SMEIL is to be able to model hardware, and since hardware is static, it was important to create a type system that was cabable of enforcing as many static invariants as possible. Therefore only between signed and unsigned integers is type coercion performed in SMEIL, which also means that only booleans can be used in conditionals.
It is easy to transform a statically typed language to a dynamically typed language, but not the other way around, therefore SMEIL will be simple to translate to various different target languages.

The SMEIL type system differs from standard general-purpose languages mainly on the support for bit-precise types. In general-purpose languages it is typical targeted a CPU which consists of fixed-width registers which typically means that it can not work with data smaller than a byte. This is, however, an important part of modeling hardware to be able to define the exact widths of the wires in order to optimise the hardware implementation. SMEIL supports unlimited-size integers as well as integers constained to a specific bit-length. SMEIL also supports booleans, double and single precision floating point numbers as well as strings. Currenly, floating-point numbers are not supported in the SMEIL hardware-translations. %TODO Venter på svar omkring hvad det her egentligt betyder? Og tjek lige at jeg ikke også skriver om det i analyse.
Arrays of a fixed length of the types, mentioned above, are also supported.

In SMEIL buses are represented as channel names and their types, and since processes or networks can accept buses passed as parameters it is important to ensure that no process or network is instantiated with a bus that does not contain the expected channels.
In the same way, it is essential to ensure that the directionality of the bus is enforced. When buses are passed as parameters, they are explicitly declared as either input or output bus. However, when defining a bus within a process it is not possible to define the directionality of the bus. Therefore the bus are defined as input or output based on their first use.
The type system of SMEIL is enforcing a set of rules that define how two buses are unified and the directionality of the bus, which ensures that problems such as the ones described above, does not happen.
All types of declarations in SMEIL are private exept bus declarations. As mentioned above, they are used for establishing communication between processes and therefore needs to be a part of the public interface of a process or network.

\subsubsection{Simulating SMEIL programs}
When translating SMEIL to hardware models, it is necessary to have all types in the program constrained to a specific width. However, as mentioned before, SMEIL does support unlimited size integers. Since it can be difficult to define an optimal width when writing the SME model, there was a need to provide both the support of the unlimited size integers while still being able to translate to hardware descriptions.
Therefore libsme provides a way to re-type the SME network based on the values that where observed during the simulation of the program.
During the simulation, the observed minimun and maximum value for all variables and channel are captured and saved along with the original value.
After the simulation, these minimum and maximum values are then converted into SMEIL types large enough to hold the range.
The new SMEIL program with the updated types and observed ranges are then passed through the type checker, in order to ensure that all constraints from the original program is still respected.
% An example of this can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:smeil_restricted_types_and_ranges} where a unlimited size integer is re-typed to an integer of fixed size after the simulation. In Figure \ref{fig:invalid} an example of a violation can be seen. Here the value c is contrained to \texttt{i10} but if the channel \texttt{b.chan} observe values that are 16-bit long then the restrictions on the c variable are violated.

\subsubsection{Co-simulation}
Often when modeling hardware in Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog, code for testing and verifying are often written in the same language as the design itself. Unfortunately, the HDLs often does not have the functionality for generating proper simulation input. Using general-purpose languages for testing hardware models are useful since the range of available libraries are much larger.
Therefore the SMEIL simulator provides a simple language-independent API which enables SME implementations written for general-purpose languages to communicate with SME networks written in SMEIL, so-called co-simulation.
The big advantage of the SMEIL approach to co-simulation is that SME is used on both sides of the co-simulation and therefore both sides acts as a single entity.
The PySME %TODO: Reference
library have been extended to support co-simulation with SMEIL, thereby providing the posibility of writing networks in PySME which can interact with SME networks written in SMEIL. Currently, this extension have only been implemented in the PySME implementation, but is expected to be implemented in the other SME implementations as well.\\
Another functionality of the libsme compiler is, when simulating the SMEIL network, the compiler can record a trace of all communication between processes in the network. This trace file can then be used as a source for the VHDL test bench which can be used to verify the generated VHDL code.

% Some parts of the SMEIL grammar is not implemented in SMEIL yet and therefore we are also not supporting these.
In Figure~\ref{fig:smeil_transpiler} the SMEIL transpiler structure can be seen.

\section{CSP}
\label{sec:csp_background}
Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)~\cite{Hoare1978} is a process algebra that provides a way to express interaction between processes of concurrent systems.
CSP had a lot of influence in the design of the programming language Occam as well as the Go programming languages and several other. As described in Chapter \ref{chap:related-work}, it was first itroduced in 1976 by C.A.R Hoare but only later on did it develop into a process algebra. CSP is still the subject of research and due to the tools available today, it is increasingly becomming a more accessable tool for the interested user.

CSP provides the posibility of describing systems in terms of message passing communication between independently operating processes. The \textit{sequential} part of the CSP name is not exactly applicable anymore, since the current version of CSP allows not only sequential processes, but also processes consisting of parallel compositions of other primitive processes.
By using message passing between processes the language avoids certain problems that arise with the use of e.g shared variables.
With the use of the process algebra of CSP, it is possible to describe complex
parallel structures with a few simple elements of the algebra.

In CSP, a process is described by the way it can communicate with its external environment. An essential part of this communication is the \textit{alphabet} of possible communication events. This is the set of events that the proces, and related processes, can use for communication. Events in CSP are instantanious and they can only occur when both the process and the envionment allow.

% ------
%TODO: Figure out if this should be here or somewhere else in the report
Here we give a brief introduction to the essential parts of CSP and structures that we are using in TAPS, in order to give the reader a basic understanding to build on with \cspm and FDR. If the reader wish to learn more in dept about CSP we refer to the book \textit{The Theory and Practice of Concurrency}~\cite{Roscoe1997} or \textit{Understanding Concurrent Systems}~\cite{Roscoe2010} by A. W. Roscoe.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prefix:} Given an event $a$ in the alphabet $\Sigma$, and a process $P$, $a \rightarrow P$ is the process which will communicate $a$ and then behaves like the proces $P$. The process will wait indefinitely to communicate $a$. This is known as prefixing.\\
    The simplest CSP process possible are the \textit{STOP} process. It never does anything and never communicates. The process $left \rightarrow right \rightarrow left \rightarrow right \rightarrow STOP$ is the proces which communicates a cycle of left and right two times before stopping. Another very often used process are the \textit{SKIP} process which the process which terminates successfully.
    \item \textbf{Recursion:} The process described above ends with \textit{STOP}, but if we wish to have a process that performs the communication indefinitely, then we use recursion.
    $P_1 = left \rightarrow right \rightarrow left \rightarrow right \rightarrow P_1$ will simply loop forever.
    \item \textbf{Guarded Alternative:} The guarded alternative provides a choice to the environment of different actions. A simple choice statement could be $a \rightarrow P | b \rightarrow Q$ which gives the environment the posibility of choosing either to communicate $a$ and then behave as $P$ or communicate $b$ and then behave as $Q$.
    \item \textbf{Events:} As described above, the only possible communication between processes are events within the defined alphabet. If $A \in \Sigma$ then the process $?x : A \rightarrow P(x)$ is the process which accepts a alement $x$ of the set $A$ and then behaves like the process $P(x)$.
    It is often valuable to have a "channel" to communicate values on between channels. Therefore if $c$ is the channel, then $c?x : A \rightarrow P(x)$ is the process which receives an element $x$ on the channel $c$. This can also be written simply as $c?x \rightarrow P(x)$ where $A$ is the type of $c$. The "outputs" can be written in two ways; $c.x$ and $c!x$ are equivalent. An example of a simple process receiving an element and outputting it will be; $P = c?x \rightarrow c!x \rightarrow P$.
    \item \textbf{Deterministic Choice:} Also called external choice is the operator which offers the environment the choice between two different processes. $(a \rightarrow P) \square (b \rightarrow Q)$ in this example the environment choose to either perform event $a$ and then behave as the process $P$ or perform event $b$ and then behave as the process $Q$. This is completely the same as the guarded alternative example given above, and usually it is equivalent, however some advanced uses of external choice might be hard to express simply with guarded alternative.
    \item \textbf{Nondeterministic Choice:} Also called internal choice, defines the choice between two processes but is not affected by the envionment to make the decision.
    $(a \rightarrow P) \sqcap (b \rightarrow Q)$ can perform event $a$ or $b$ and then behave as the corresponding process, but it does not have to accept either. It is only required to accept one if the environment offers both of them.
    \item \textbf{Conditional Choice:} Conditional choices are also possible in CSP. Conditionals can be represented in different ways, which we will explain more about in the \cspm{} section below. Hoares syntax for conditionals are $a \cond{b} c$ %TODO: Find out how to write this symbols in latex
    So $ P symbol(b) Q$ which is the same as $if b then P else Q$.
    \item \textbf{Interleaving:} This operator represents concurrent activity between two independent processes. $ P  |||  Q$ defines a process behaving like $P$ and $Q$ simultaneously.
     \item \textbf{Generalised Parallel:} This operator represents two processes concurrent activity but where the processes are required to syncronise on the set of events, defined in the operator. $ P  |[\{ a \}]|  Q$ defines the process where $P$ and $Q$ must syncronise on event $a$ before the event can occur. All events not defined within the synchronisation can happen at any given time.
     \item \textbf{Hide:} This operator represents a process which performs any event from the set defined, but the event is hidden and becomming an internal event, a \textit{tau}.
\end{itemize}

A \textit{trace} in CSP is the sequence of communications between the process and the environment. Each element in the trace is the record of a single communication with the process and a trace can be used to specify correctness of a CSP process. If $traces(P)$ denote the finite set of communication events of the process $P$, then we can write $$ P \sqsubseteq_T Q \text{ if and only if } traces(P) \supseteq traces(Q)$$
This means that every trace of $Q$ is a trace of $P$ and is called \textit{trace-refine}.

% -----
% TODO: This below is not good. Write something about traces, failures ect. here when I have learned more.
% TODO: Written a lot like the wikipedia page. This require a rewrite!
% There are three denotanional semantics models in CSP, which are the \textit{traces} model, the \textit{failures} model, and the \textit{failures divergences} model. The \textit{trace} model define a process expression as a set of sequential events, traces, that the process can perform. $traces(STOP) = {<>}$ means that the trace of the process \textit{STOP} is the empty set, since the process performs no events. $traces(a \rightarrow b \rightarrow STOP = \{<>, <a>, <a,b>\})$ means that the trace of the process defined above can either be no events performed, the event $a$ performed or both event $a$ and then event $b$.\\
% The failures model is similar to the trace model, but consists of a set of refusals, which are the set of events that a process can refuse to perform. A failure consists of both a trace and a set of refusals, which identifies the events that the process can refuse when it has executed the trace. $failures((a \rightarrow STOP) \square (b \rightarrow Q) = \{(<>, \emptyset), (<a>, \{a,b\}), (<b>, \{a.b\})\})$\\
% The last model, the \textit{failures divergences} is en extension of the failures model. The model is defined as a pair... %TODO: Explain better, the wikipedia site is weird and I dont really understand it. I should understand what I write!

\subsection{\cspm{}}
In 1998 Bryan Scattergood introduced the machine-readable CSP, called \cspm. This language is an adaption and extension of the process algebra~\cite{Brookes1984} that Brookes, Hoare and Roscoe introduced.  The process algebra notation is extended with a functional programming language to be able to express CSP in a functional way, providing a language which can be used with tools and therefore provide a broader usability to CSP.
\cspm use the existing theory of CSP and the language, in spite of being combined with a functional programming language, retains the idioms of CSP.
The main purpose of creating \cspm was not so it could be executed, like the reason for most programming languages are. The main reason was to provide an approach to describe parallel systems in a structure which can be automatically manipolated. This can be done for instance, with tools like FDR4. This also means that a program written in \cspm cannot be executed and simulated like a network can be simulated in SMEIL. \\

\subsubsection{Essentials of \cspm}
The basics of a \cspm script is to define the processes, its functionality and the communication. \cspm supports sequences, sets, booleans, tuples, user-defined types, local definitions, pattern matching and lambda terms.
\cspm does not enforce restrictions on the use of upper/lower-case letters in identifiers, although some standard convensions can be followed if suitable. It is common to define processes either all in capital letters or with an initial capital letter. Channels and function naming are typically all in lowercase lettering.\\

\cspm also supports integer arithmetics like addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder/modulus and unary minus. Integer arithmetics are supported within a signed or twos-complement 32-bit representation.
Floating point numbers are currently not supporten in \cspm. \\

\cspm provide several different build-in function, like \texttt{concat(s)} or \texttt{elem(x,s)}, which both takes sequences as parameters, or \texttt{card(a)} or \texttt{union(a, b)} which are set functions. All of these are very common in functional programming languages. \cspm support boolean \texttt{and}, \texttt{or}, \texttt{not}, equality operations as well as ordering operations and conditional expressions. In \cspm, all types except functions and processes can be compared with the equality operators. Ordering are not defined on booleans or user-defined types. \\

Local definitions can be defined by wrapping them inside a \texttt{let within} statement. For example \texttt{P(n) = let (x,y) = n within x + y }\\ Channel and datatype definitions can only be defined at top-level and therefore not in a \texttt{let within} statement. \\
\cspm provides support for lambda terms which have the syntax: $\ x_1,...,x_n @ x$, an example could be \texttt{f = \ x, y @ x \% y}. \\
It is simple and ideal to use pattern matching in a lot of cases in \cspm, similar to most functional programming languages. Case statements can be defined via pattern matching as well as in comprehensions, communicatins ect. however there are several rules that belongs to pattern matching within \cspm which we will not introduce here but merely reference the \cspm Reference Manual~\cite{Scattergood2011} for more information. \\

% TODO: Figure out if I need to explain named types and data types in cspm
In \cspm a channel is defined with the keyword \texttt{channel} and an identifier as tag. Channels can be simple structures like \texttt{channel clock} or more complex like \texttt{channel c : \{0..10\}} which represents that the channel can communicate integers in the range of 0 to 10. A channel becomes an event when all necessary values have been provided. With channel \texttt{c}, \texttt{c.5} is a value of type Event. All events are members of the build-in data type \texttt{Events}. It is possible to define channels to be infinite, but when using \cspm in FDR4, it is not common use. \\

\subsubsection{\cspm Processes}
In \cspm processes are defined much like described in section \ref{sec:csp_background}, above. We are still defining the \texttt{SKIP} and the\texttt{STOP} processes as well as prefixing, external choice, internal choice and interleaving. Communication are done with the\texttt{?} and\texttt{!} operator, for example\texttt{Proc(c) = c?x -> c!x -> Proc(c).} are the process which receives an element on the channel\texttt{c} and outputs it on the same channel agian. \\
Sequential composition are defined with semicolon, for example\texttt{P;Q} are first behaving like\texttt{P} and when\texttt{P} have terminated, it behaves like\texttt{Q}. \\
External choice are defined with\texttt{P [] Q} and internal choice with\texttt{P |~| Q}. A boolean guard,\texttt{b \& P} is the same as\texttt{if b then P else STOP}.
Generalised parallel are defined by\texttt{P [| A |] Q}, similar to how it is defined in the section above. It is worth noting that \texttt{P [| {} |] Q} is the same as using the interleave operator. \\
It is also possible to define alphabetised parallel, \texttt{P [A || B] Q}, which means that the set of events, \texttt{A}, are events that\texttt{P} is allowed to perform and the set of events,\texttt{B} are the events allowed by\texttt{Q}.\\
In \cspm when we wish to assert that some property hold for some process within the \cspm scripts. A basic assertion could be \texttt{assert 4 < 9}, but could also be used to express refinement checks, which is how FDR4 use assertions, which we explain further in the section below.\\

\subsection{FDR4}
%" FDR2 is often described as a model checker, but is technically a refinement checker, in that it converts two CSP process expressions into Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs), and then determines whether one of the processes is a refinement of the other within some specified semantic model (traces, failures, or failures/divergence)" (from Wikipedia - se paper \textit{Model-checking CSP - af Roscoe} \\\\

We not only want to transpile SMEIL to \cspm{}, we also want to be able to verify different properties in \cspm{} in order to prove correctness. Today, there exists several tools for formal verification, both in academia and in the industry. One of the currently most favored tools is the Failures-Divergences Refinement tool (FDR4). This tool is a CSP refinement checker that can analyze programs written in the machine-readable version of CSP; \cspm{}.
It provides a parallel refinement-checking engine that can scale up linearly with the number of cores. This means that it can handle processes with a large number of states in a reasonable time. FDR4 can handle several different types of assertions, deadlocks being the most used. However, due to the structure of SMEIL, we use FDR4 in a different way than is typical. Since the SME model cannot have cyclic-wait we have no need to verify the system in this manner.

For our current implementation of the transpiler, we can assert the ranges of the channel inputs, for example, we can automatically assert that the observed ranges, provided by the SMEIL simulation, and the possible input on the \cspm{} channels are not conflicting.
In hardware, we would typically want to verify that the communication on a bus does not exceed a certain range or that the sum of multiple signals does not exceed a specific value. A bus might be able to carry other data than needed, and being able to model a circuit that can assert that the bus never carries other data than expected, is of great value.
\\

CSP was not initially developed for hardware modeling, and therefore it is not evident how to handle the clock cycle, which is an essential part of hardware modeling. When we transpile the SME network into \cspm{} the SMEIL simulation have provided the ranges of all values from the simulation and therefore all clock cycles. This means that when FDR4 asserts a property it asserts on all possible communication combinations for all the simulated clock cycles. Therefore, even though we are transpiling from an SME model, where the clock is crucial, we can simply translate ``one-to-one" from the SMEIL program and still get an accurate assertion on the properties.

Integer division is defined to round down and the modulus operation always provides a positive result.
