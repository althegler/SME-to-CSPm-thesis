We have presented a transpiler that transpiles SME intermediate language (SMEIL) into \cspm{} for then to use the Failure-Divergences Refinement tool (FDR4) to assert properties in a \cspm{} network. We provide a simple approach that makes it more accessible for software programmers to program hardware and thereby bridging a gap between software programmers and the needs of the industry.
Instead of having to create advanced test-benches, our tool provides a simple way to verify the hardware model via FDR4s assertion functionalities. We can assert that the observed values of a channel, in a simulated SMEIL program, are in fact the only possible values communicated on that specific channel. We have also shown this to work in an example case of a seven segment display.
