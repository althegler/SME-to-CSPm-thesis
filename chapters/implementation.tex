In this chapter I introduce some of the main challenges in translating from SMEIL to \cspm{}, and how they have been solved in TAPS.\\

The requirements for TAPS are considerable because of the flexibility of SMEIL. Translating the different functionalities of SMEIL have been prioritised according to the requirements of the examples used within this thesis, and due to time restrictions, the current version of TAPS does not support the entire SMEIL grammar. TAPS expects a well-formed legal SMEIL program as input and does not perform any type-checking. The best way to ensure an accurate translation to \cspm{} is to simulate the SMEIL program before using TAPS, in order to ensure that the program complies with all the rules of the LIBSME compiler.
\section{Transpiling SMEIL Statements}
SMEIL statements are defining the functionality of the process and can consist of simple arithmetic operations, conditionals, or communication.
The statements are translated into the \texttt{let within} structure as introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:design}.\\

All assignments in SMEIL are translated directly into \cspm{} without much change, however if the assignment is consisting of communication either in or out, TAPS must handle these assignments differently, which will be explained later in this section.\\

When translating a constant from SMEIL to \cspm{}, the constant is added to the \cspm{} program separately from the process it was defined within.
The SMEIL programs must be well-formed, and thus the constant will only be used by the process it was defined within. It is therefore not a problem to have the constant defined outside of the \cspm{} process. If a constant is defined as a process parameter in the SMEIL program, will be translated as an initial value for the process and not as a separate \cspm{} constant.\\
% NOTE Constants are currently not implemented in TAPS

Variables in SMEIL can be instantiated with an initial value, and therefore TAPS must search through all the variable declarations in the SMEIL process. If a variable is defined with an initial value, this information is gathered so that the initial value of the variable can be added to the generated \cspm{} process.
Variables with no initial value will be ignored by TAPS because they do not need instantiation in \cspm{}, and will be translated along with the other statements. With the current version of TAPS, only values communicated on channels are verified, and therefore the range and type of a variable have no purpose within the generated \cspm{} code. It would, however, be simple to gather this information if needed.\\

The \texttt{trace} statement in SMEIL is not affecting the behaviour of the process. It prints out the string and arguments that are given, like a printf in C. It is possible to add a \texttt{print} statement in \cspm{}, but it has a very different functionality than the \texttt{trace} statement in SMEIL. A \texttt{print} statement in a \cspm{} program will appear in the right-hand side of the FDR4 session window, where it can be activated for easy evaluation. It does not support printing out text, but rather calculations and thus the \texttt{trace} statement in SMEIL is not compatible with the \texttt{print} statement in \cspm{}.\\

The \texttt{assert} statement is used internally in SMEIL and evaluated during program execution. If the \texttt{assert} statement is not valid, then the execution is halted and the error message, defined in the \texttt{assert} statement, is printed. An example can be seen below.
\begin{minted}{smeil_lexer.py:SMEILLexer -x}
assert(hour < 23, "hours must be less than 23");
\end{minted}
Even though the purpose of this project is to assert properties in FDR4, the properties that FDR4 can verify are not similar to the properties that the \texttt{assert} statement in SMEIL can assert. As was introduced in Section \ref{sec:background_fdr}, FDR4 is a refinement checker and the \texttt{assert} statements in FDR4 are asserting the refinement checks. In the \cspm{} language, assertions like \texttt{assert 4 + 4 == 8} are possible, however FDR4 does not support this. The two types of \texttt{assert} statements are therefore not equivalent.\\

Neither the SMEIL \texttt{trace} statement nor the \texttt{assert} statement provides any functionality to the translation or the network model, so there are two options for how TAPS should handle these. Either TAPS throws them away, or it keeps them as comments for reference in the generated code. Currently, TAPS throw them away, but it would be possible to change this and add them as comments in the generated \cspm{} code.\\
% NOTE: Assertions are not curently implemented in TAPS. Trace is.

Expressions in SMEIL and their precedence rules are similar to C-like languages, and they are used for defining operations and naming in SMEIL. All of the standard binary operators behave the same in SMEIL as in \cspm{}, as well as relational operators and logical conjunction and disjunction. The unary \texttt{!}(not) operator does not have the same precedence in the SMEIL grammar as in \cspm{}. Also, the equality operators and comparison operators have the same precedence in \cspm{}, but not in the SMEIL grammar. To avoid erroneous computation, TAPS adds parentheses around all nested expressions. The SMEIL grammar also consists of bitwise operations which FDR4 does not support, because \cspm{} only supports integers. It is likely possible to model the bitwise operations using the already supported operators, but this has not been a priority to implement and the current version of TAPS does not support it.\\

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:background_smeil}, SMEIL supports floating point numbers in the simulator, but this has not been extensively tested. Floating point numbers are not supported by \cspm{} because it is not possible to assert if two floating point numbers are exactly equal and therefore it is not possible to create refinement checks with floating point numbers. It is possible to create models in \cspm{} that define a floating point number, but the type itself is not supported in \cspm{} or FDR4. TAPS does not provide any type checking and therefore it does not provide a warning if floating point numbers occur within an SMEIL program.
\section{Transpiling Channels}
 The read and write syntax in SMEIL is used as a variable in the SMEIL process. In Listing \ref{lst:implementation_smeil_input_parameter}, the syntax \texttt{inbus.val} indicates a read to the channel \texttt{val} within the bus \texttt{inbus}. As can be seen, the read and write structures are used as if they are simple variables representing a value.\\

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{smeil_lexer.py:SMEILLexer -x}
proc double (in inbus)
    bus outbus {
        val: uint;
    };
{
    outbus.val = inbus.val * 2;
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Example of a read and a write in SMEIL.}
\label{lst:implementation_smeil_input_parameter}
\end{listing}
SMEIL does not separate the communication and calculation in a process statement as can also be seen in Listing \ref{lst:implementation_smeil_input_parameter}. This is of great advantage in SMEIL, but the translation becomes more complex.
TAPS must be able to recognise the communication in an assignment which is possible because both the bus and the channel must be specified in a read or write in SMEIL. If one of the elements in an assignment, right or left-hand side, contains a dot, TAPS can assume that it is communication. The original grammar of an assignment like the one in Listing \ref{lst:implementation_smeil_input_parameter} can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:smeil_assignment_grammar}. A communication is the \textit{hierarchical accessor} alternative in the \textit{name} rule. The communication can either be the right-hand side of the assignment, which is a write, or part of the left-hand side expression, which is a read. A write is simple to recognise since it is not combined with other parts of the grammar. TAPS can search the \textit{name} of a right-hand side assignment and see if it contains a dot.
A read can be used as an internal variable in the expressions and therefore TAPS must search all names within the nested expression to find a potential read.
\begin{listing}
\begin{grammar}
<statement> ::= <name> `=' <expression> `;' (assignment)

<name> ::= <ident>
\alt <name> `.' <name> (hierarchical accessor)
\alt <name> `[' <array-index> `]' (array element access)

<expression> ::= <name>
\alt <literal>
\alt <expression> <bin-op> <expression>
\alt <un-op> <expression>
\alt <name> `(' \{ <expression> \}  `)' (function call)
\alt `(' <expression> `)'


\end{grammar}
\caption{The original assignment, name and expression grammars defined in \cite{Asheim2018}.}
\label{lst:smeil_assignment_grammar}
\end{listing}
\subsection{Naming Channels}
When translating an SMEIL bus channel to a \cspm{} channel, TAPS must define \cspm{} channel names that are unique, the same way that the formal name of a bus channel in SMEIL is unique.\\

The simplest way of translating the SMEIL channels into \cspm{} channels is to use the already defined formal name of the SMEIL bus channel. By concatenating the channel name, bus name, and process name into a single channel name in \cspm{}, the naming becomes unique.
This means that all reads and writes using the syntax \texttt{outbus.val} from the process \texttt{double} in SMEIL, will be translated to \texttt{double\_outbus\_val} in \cspm{}.
It is also possible to use randomly generated strings instead of using the original SMEIL names, but to ensure the readability of the generated code, it is necessary to have recognisable names for the \cspm{} channels.\\

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{smeil_lexer.py:SMEILLexer -x}
network net() {
    instance c of clock();
    instance a of A(c.outbus, val: 1);
    instance _ of A(c.outbus, val: 2);
    instance s of src(a.outbus);
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Example of a network with four instances, where two are instances of the same process.}
\label{lst:Instance_variations}
\end{listing}
The example in Listing \ref{lst:Instance_variations} shows a network consisting of four instances, where two of them are instantiating the same process with different constant parameters. All but one instance declaration also includes an instance name which can be used when referencing the process in the instance parameters. SMEIL enforces the rule that two instances of the same process cannot both have the anonymous instance name, defined as \texttt{\_}.\\

% NOTE: SMEIL does not support adding instance names to the cspm channel name
With two instances of the same process in SMEIL, the \cspm{} channels of those processes, would have identical names. It is of course crucial to avoid duplicate channel names, and therefore TAPS looks through the instances in the SMEIL network, and appends the instance name to the \cspm{} channel name. If the instance name is anonymous, a \texttt{\_} is appended to the \cspm{} channel for simplicity. The restrictions against identical process instances in SMEIL ensures that there will never be two identical named \cspm{} channels in the generated code.
It is also possible to have bus declarations within the network declaration in SMEIL. These bus channels are named in the same manner as other channels in \cspm{}, however without an instance name appended.
The naming of each channel quickly becomes long and chaotic, which is one of the compromises of generated code.
\subsection{\cspm{} Channel Range}
When defining channels in \cspm{} it is important to define a restricted range of acceptable values for each channel. If the channel is defined with an unbounded range of integers, FDR4 would search through all possible integers which would result in a state space explosion and FDR4 would run out of space. These restricted ranges must of course represent relevant values.\\

As explained in Chapter~\ref{chap:analysis}, all simulated SMEIL channels and variables are defined with a range of observed values and a restricted type.
Because FDR4 only supports integers, only signed and unsigned integer types are supported in TAPS. The integer following the type defines the bit size of the observed values. This bit size is used to generate a restricted range for the \cspm{} channel, and thereby avoid having a seemingly endless runtime in FDR4.\\

In Listing ~\ref{lst:range_smeil} in Chapter \ref{chap:analysis}, the simulated \texttt{seconds} process from the seven segments display example can be seen. The types of the two channels are \texttt{u3} and \texttt{u4} and the observed values are between 0 and 5 for the first digit and 0 and 9 for the second. TAPS converts the bit size of the type \texttt{u3} to the range \texttt{\{0..7\}} which is then used as the restricted range for the \cspm{} channel representing the first digit. The second digit channel type \texttt{u4} is converted to the range \texttt{\{0..15\}}. In Listing~\ref{lst:channel_range_cspm}, the converted ranges are defining the values of the \cspm{} channels.\\

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{cspm_lexer.py:CSPmLexer -x}
channel seconds_out_first_digit : {0..7}
channel seconds_out_second_digit : {0..15}

Seconds(seconds_in) =
let
    seconds = seconds_in % 60
    seconds_first_temp = seconds / 10
    seconds_second_temp = seconds % 10
within
    seconds_out_first_digit ! seconds_first_temp ->
    seconds_out_second_digit ! seconds_second_temp ->
    SKIP
\end{minted}
\caption{Example of the \texttt{Seconds} process from the generated \cspm{} code in the seven segment display example. See the full code in Listing~\ref{lst:cspm} in Appendix \ref{app:seven_segments}.}
\label{lst:channel_range_cspm}
\end{listing}

It might seem redundant to create \cspm{} channels with a limited range, when TAPS is also asserting the widths of the channels. FDR4 will always only perform refinement checks using the values defined for each channel in \cspm{}, and therefore there seems to be no point in asserting if the values go beyond this range. The method for performing usable refinement checks is to use both the type and the range of observed values, defined for each simulated SMEIL channel. The range of observed values are used within the monitor process to ensure that no values outside the range are communicated on the channel, and because the range of the bit size can only be equal or larger than the range of the observed values, the assertions become valuable. \\

As explained previously, an SMEIL data generator process will be translated into a \cspm{} channel. In this case, it is important to use the bit size range for the \cspm{} channel, because otherwise it is not possible to guarantee the precise input values in the network. If TAPS were to use the range of observed values, the monitor process assertions will always pass because the input values are the exact values used for the simulation. These input values are the base of all the observed values for all SMEIL channels, so the assertions would never fail. It is therefore necessary to have a range of input that goes beyond the range of observed values, in order to verify that the model can handle a larger range of input without failures.
\section{Generating Monitor Processes}
It is clear that all channels except data generator channels must be verified with FDR4 and thus TAPS must generate a monitor process for all channels except the data generator channels.\\

As explained above, the observed values for each SMEIL channel are used within the monitor processes to verify the values communicated on the channels. For TAPS to be able to generate the monitor process, it is essential that all the channels are defined with observed values. In the original SMEIL grammar, defined in \cite{Asheim2018}, it is optional to include a range in a bus channel definition as can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:smeil_bus_grammar}.
In order to restrict the SMEIL network to include ranges for each SMEIL bus channel before translating with TAPS, I have changed the original grammar of SMEIL. The grammar shown in Listing \ref{lst:smeil_bus_grammar_no_option} is slightly different compared to the grammar defined in Listing \ref{lst:smeil_bus_grammar}. The difference is that a range is no longer optional and that the keyword \texttt{exposed} is no longer allowed. The keyword \texttt{exposed} can be defined for a bus in SMEIL to indicate buses that communicate with another SME implementation using co-simulation, but since TAPS does not support co-simulation, this keyword is not needed. A consequence of this change in the grammar is that the output bus channels within the data generator process must be defined with a range, even though the range is not needed for the translation. Because the data generator processes are not defined differently in SMEIL, the same grammar rules apply to them.\\

\begin{listing}
    \begin{grammar}
    <bus-decl> ::= [ `exposed' ] `bus' <ident> `\{' <bus-signal-decls> `\}'  `;'

    <bus-signal-decls> ::= <bus-signal-decl> \{ <bus-signal-decl> \}

    <bus-signal-decl> ::= <ident> `:' <type> [ `=' <expression> ] [ <range> ] `;'
    \end{grammar}
    \caption{The bus grammar defined in \cite{Asheim2018}. The square brackets indicate an optional nonterminal and curly brackets indicate zero or more nonterminals.}
    \label{lst:smeil_bus_grammar}
\end{listing}
\begin{listing}
    \begin{grammar}
    <bus-decl> ::= `bus' <ident> `\{' <bus-signal-decls> `\}'  `;'

    <bus-signal-decls> ::= <bus-signal-decl> \{ <bus-signal-decl> \}

    <bus-signal-decl> ::= <ident> `:' <type> [ `=' <expression> ] <range> `;'
    \end{grammar}
    \caption{The bus grammar defined in \cite{Asheim2018} changed to match the demands of the translation.}
    \label{lst:smeil_bus_grammar_no_option}
\end{listing}
The monitor process asserts that the observed values from the SMEIL simulation are the only values communicated on the channels. The two monitors of the \texttt{Seconds} process from the seven segments example can be seen in Listing~\ref{lst:monitor_range_cspm}. The values used for these monitors are 0 through 5 for the first digit monitor and 0 through 9 for the second digit monitor. These values have been defined for each channel in the simulated SMEIL program in Listing~\ref{lst:range_smeil} in Chapter \ref{chap:analysis}.
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{cspm_lexer.py:CSPmLexer -x}
Seconds_out_first_digit_monitor(c) =
    c ? x ->
    (0 <= x and x <= 5) & SKIP
Seconds_out_second_digit_monitor(c) =
    c ? x ->
    (0 <= x and x <= 9) & SKIP
\end{minted}
\caption{Example of the two generated \texttt{Seconds} monitor processes from the seven segment display example. See the full code in Listing~\ref{lst:cspm} in Appendix \ref{app:seven_segments}.}
\label{lst:monitor_range_cspm}
\end{listing}
Each monitor asserts values on one channel, and thus the name of the monitor process is the channel name with \texttt{\_monitor} appended. This means that TAPS can easily find the name of the monitor process from the channel name, and vice versa.
Since no \cspm{} channels can have identical names, this ensures that no monitor processes will have colliding names.\\

Using this monitor process structure in the seven segments display example also expose a limitation to the structure. In the \texttt{Hour} process, the observed values are \{0..2\} for the first digit, and \{0..9\} for the second digit. This combination of values can represent 24 hours, as expected, but it will also accept values from 25 to 29 because the digits are evaluated separately. In order to solve this, it would be necessary to assert values across more than one channel in a monitor process. This has been mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:future} as future work, since it is not yet implemented.
\section{Generating a \cspm{} Network}
The process monitor network consists of three parts. The first part consists of reading input values for the process. As explained previously, all reads will be performed outside the process itself. From the instance parameters, defined in SMEIL, TAPS will look up the name of the SMEIL process where the input is defined. The read within the SMEIL process defines the specific channel to read from. This information is gathered to clarify which \cspm{} channel the process monitor network should read from. Each read is added using prefixing, so it would also work if there are more than one input bus for the process. An example of the first part of the network can be seen in Listing \ref{lst:network_first_part}.
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{cspm_lexer.py:CSPmLexer -x}
N_seconds = clock_out_val ? variable -> ...
\end{minted}
\caption{First part of the network generation where an input value is read from the channel \texttt{clock\_out\_val}.}
\label{lst:network_first_part}
\end{listing}
% NOTE: TAPS does not currently support more than one input channel
The second part is to add the process name with the expected parameters, both input values, output channels as well as constants and internal values. The example in Listing \ref{lst:network_second_part} is a continuation of the example in Listing \ref{lst:network_first_part}.
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{cspm_lexer.py:CSPmLexer -x}
N_seconds = clock_out_val ? variable -> Seconds(variable) ...
\end{minted}
\caption{The second part added to the network generation in \cspm{}.}
\label{lst:network_second_part}
\end{listing}

In the last part, TAPS will synchronise the process with the monitor processes over the channels they are asserting.
For each monitor process TAPS builds a new layer of synchronisation around the network. This is straightforward to automatically generate, since TAPS can loop over the list of writes for the process. \\

Listing \ref{lst:network_example_cspm} shows the network generated from the translated \texttt{Seconds} process in Listing \ref{lst:channel_range_cspm} and the corresponding monitor processes in Listing \ref{lst:monitor_range_cspm}. Adding parentheses around each synchronisation, the \texttt{first digit} monitor process is synchronised on the \texttt{first digit} channel and the \texttt{second digit} monitor process is synchronised on the \texttt{second digit} channel which completes the process monitor network.\\

Lastly the \cspm{} \texttt{assert} operator is specifying the refinement check for FDR4. The assertion defines a refinement check from the specification process \texttt{SKIP} and the implementation process \texttt{N\_seconds}. The assert statement also indicates that the refinement check should be performed using the failures model.\\
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{cspm_lexer.py:CSPmLexer -x}
N_seconds = clock_out_val ? variable ->
            (Seconds(variable)
            [| {| seconds_out_first_digit|} |]
            Seconds_out_first_digit_monitor(seconds_out_first_digit))
            [| {| seconds_out_second_digit|} |]
            Seconds_out_second_digit_monitor(seconds_out_second_digit)

assert SKIP [F= N_seconds \ Events
\end{minted}
\caption{Example of the \texttt{Seconds} network processes from the generated \cspm{} code in the seven segment display example. See the full code in Listing~\ref{lst:cspm} in Appendix \ref{app:seven_segments}.}
\label{lst:network_example_cspm}
\end{listing}

In SMEIL it is possible to define more than one network within the same SMEIL program. This is not a problem for TAPS to translate as long as the program is still a well-formed SMEIL program. Each instance defines a process and its parameters. The communication will always refer to a specific bus, defined in either a process or a network. This will not change no matter how many networks are defined within the program, because communication cannot span across networks.
In theory, it is possible to create nested networks where a network can instantiate other networks, and thereby allowing communication across networks, but this has not yet been implemented in SMEIL and therefore TAPS does not support this.
The only situation where several networks can become a problem for TAPS is if the networks have instance names in common. As mentioned above, it is necessary to include the instance name in the name of a generated \cspm{} channel in order to tell the difference between two \cspm{} channels originating from the same process. If there is more than one network using the same instance name for a specific process, the generated code would have identical channel names in one \cspm{} program. To solve this, TAPS could include the network name in the generated \cspm{} channel name to add another layer of separation. This is a corner case, and the current version of TAPS does not support this solution, but since it is a potential problem it is important to indentify.

\section{The Technologies of TAPS}
The two main parts of TAPS are the parser and the code generator. The parser is created with ANTLR4~\cite{Parr2012}, which is described further below. The data transformation and code generation have been developed in Python 2.7. The templating language Jinja2~\cite{jinja2} has been used to define and generate the standard \cspm{} structures, that the SMEIL program will be translated into.\\

The SMEIL program is parsed using ANTLR4 and the resulting parse tree is traversed, while TAPS collects all relevant data from the SMEIL program. The data is then transformed to match the requirements of the \cspm{} structures used for the code generation. Together with the transformed data, TAPS uses the templates to generate the \cspm{} code. The generated code can then can be verified in FDR4. \\

Often when developing any form of translation either by a compiler or interpreter, the use of a symbol table is often necessary in order to keep information about variable names, types, values etc. During the translation when reaching a symbol, the system will use the symbol table to look up the symbol and to retrieve its context. The symbol table is usually generated in the analysis section and is used for lookups throughout the compilation or interpretation. TAPS expects the SMEIL program to be well-formed and does not provide any checking of the SMEIL code, and therefore it is not necessary for TAPS to include a symbol table to check if variables have been properly declared in the process declaration, before being used in the body of the process.
\subsection{ANTLR4}
For the transpiling from SMEIL to \cspm{}, I have decided to use a parser generator tool to generate a parser for the SMEIL language.\\

I have choosen a parser generator library because it will simplify the parsing process so I can focus more on the development of correct code generation. Parser generators are tools that provide an automatically generated parser from a specified grammar. Using a parser generator is an obvious choice since the SMEIL grammar is already in a well defined Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) format. It is also possible to create a parser from scratch but there seems to be little reason to spend the time writing and debugging a bespoke parser when I can generate it directly. \\

I have decided to use the ANTLR4 tool after looking at several other parser generator tools. ANTLR4 is a Java-based parser generator library that, based on a grammar, can generate parsers in Java or another target language, like Python 2.7. ANTLR is a well-used tool which has recently been updated to the new and improved ANTLR4 version. Companies like Twitter and Oracle are using ANTLR~\cite{Parr2012} for different parse tasks. ANTLR4 also has an active user base and there is plenty of documentation and guides for the new ANTLR4 version online. A lot of parser generator tools exists today and some of the most known parser generators are Yacc or Bison but unfortunately a lot of these tools seemed to be a bit outdated and not very user friendly in terms of error messages or simplicity in the grammar structure. ANTLR4 seems to be the right choice for this simple grammar.\\

By using ANTLR4 it is simple to transform the SMEIL grammar into a parser and lexer using the already defined SMEIL grammar. ANTLR4 supports EBNF grammers which must be defined in \texttt{.g4} file format, which is quite similar to other standard grammars. ANTLR4 also provides the possibility of generating a tree walker, which can be used to traverse the parse tree. There are three options for tree traversal, either using the listener or visitor method provided by ANTLR4 or manually traversing the parse tree.
The listener methods are called directly by the walker object, that triggers parser events for the listener to respond to. The listener is analogous to XML document handler objects that respond to SAX events triggered by XML parsers. The visitor method in ANTLR4 is similar to the standard visitor patterns seen in other parser structures. In ANTLR4 each visitor must call \texttt{visit()} on its children to walk the subtrees. ANTLR4 also provides the possibility of adding labels to alternatives in grammar rules, which creates a visitor method for each labeled alternative. This ensures a more manageable parsing and less complex visitor functions. \\

Both the visitor method and the listener method can provide the same results. In the first version of TAPS I used the listener method, but after realising that it is not necessary to traverse the entire parse tree, TAPS has been rewritten to use the visitor method that only visits the necessary subtrees.\\

After TAPS has walked the parse tree and collected all relevant information from the SMEIL program, the data is transformed to match the requirements of the \cspm{} code. For example, the name of a bus and its channels in SMEIL is transformed into combined names for the \cspm{} channels. Because TAPS only collects data during the tree walk and does not perform direct translation, it does not matter how the SMEIL code is structured. With this solution, the SMEIL network declaration can be defined first or last in the program without any difference to the translation.\\
